# Gollum_Frodo_Sam_OneRing
Ever since the One Ring was forged by the Dark Lord Sauron, few have been able to resist its seductive power. Gollum was famously corrupted by it, and during his journey to destroy it, even Frodo was tempted by it. One of the few to be able to resist the call of its power was Samwise (Sam) Gamgee.

At one point during their journey to destroy the ring, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum arrive at a river. The river is too wide and deep to swim across, but fortunately, there is a small raft docked on one side. Frodo is too tired from the burden of carrying the ring to drive the raft, however, and Gollum is too unreliable to steer. So, only Sam can steer the raft.

The raft is only large enough for two people at a time; if all three try to ride it, they will sink. So, Sam will have to take Gollum and Frodo across one at a time. However, neither Gollum nor Frodo can be trusted alone with the One Ring on either side of the river by himself. In fact, neither of them can be trusted alone on the raft with Sam and the ring: its allure is too great, and if given the opportunity, they will simply shove Sam off the side and keep the ring. Therefore, if either Frodo or Gollum is on the raft with Sam, the ring must be left on one of the riverbanks; if the ring is on the raft, then only Sam can be on the raft with it.

How can Frodo, Sam, Gollum, and the ring get across the river under these conditions? Specifically, neither Frodo nor Gollum can ever be alone with the ring on either bank of the river by himself, nor can Frodo or Gollum be on the raft with the ring. If the ring is on the raft, then only Sam can be on the raft with it. Obviously, Sam is permitted to steer the raft alone.

This OneRing.py contains a python code which resolves this problem programmatically.
